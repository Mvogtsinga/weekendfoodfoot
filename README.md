Site User
- Someone or a group of people over 18 from the sport's area
- A sport's team looking for a place to eat after the weekend's games
- People who prefers to arrange their bookings digitally to secure a place

Goals for the website
- To allow customers to see the menu before visiting the restaurant
- to allow customers to plan their booking in advance
- To safely store the bookings data and make it available for staff.
- To allow customers to view in advance the table availability
- To safely manage the food logistic
