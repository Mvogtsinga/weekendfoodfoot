My first preoccupation was to build a direct connection with a potential user. To attempt my goal I chose a mixture of Burger and hell color. 

Site User
- Someone or a group of people over 18 from the sport's area
- A sport's team looking for a place to eat after the weekend's games
- People who prefers to arrange their bookings digitally to secure a place

Goals for the website
- To allow customers to see the menu before visiting the restaurant
- to allow customers to plan their booking in advance
- To safely store the bookings data and make it available for staff.
- To allow customers to view in advance the table availability
- To safely manage the food logistic

# Wireframes
The next stage of UX design planning was the basic wireframes using Basalmiq. I wanted to create a pleasing and easy to navigate website for the potential user. 


# Technology used
The site has been built with the following tech and tools:
<ol>
  <li>HTML5</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Django - database framework</li>
  <li>ElephantSQL - database hosting</li>
  <li>Cloudinary - media hosting</li>
  <li>Bootstrap 5</li>
  <li>GitHub Repo - code storage</li>
  <li>Git - version control</li>
  <li>GitPod & VS Code - IDE</li>
  <li>Heroku - live site hosting</li>
</ol>

# Agile Development
# Testing

# Bugs
No current bugs in the project.

But some  bugs occurred during the development of the project such as:
Deploying the project to Heroku. This was solved by creating a new app.


# Deployment

Heroku was the main deployements Tools for this project. I add a Procfile and requirements.txt files to the project.

A new app was set up in Heroku and the config vars were added to the app.

GitHub was selected as the deployment menthod and the GitHub repository was linked to Heroku.

"Deploy Branch" was selected to manually deploy the project.
